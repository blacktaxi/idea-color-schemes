IDEA color schemes
==================

Just a collection of IntelliJ IDEA color schemes, sometimes created by me, that I find cool.

Installation
------------

1. Close any running instances of IDEA. (yes, this is required, at least as of version 11)
2. Copy desired color schemes to %IDEA_HOME%/config/colors .
3. Enjoy.

%IDEA_HOME% might be one of the following, depending on used version:

- ~/IntelliJIdea11 for full version of IDEA 11
- ~/IdeaIC11 for community edition of IDEA 11
